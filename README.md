# ProvMark

ProvMark is a fully automated system that generates system level provenance benchmarks from provenance information collected by different provenance collection tools and systems, such as SPADE, OPUS and CamFlow.

# System Description

## Stage 1 Execute provenance collecting tools of choice on chosen syscall benchmark program (and control program)
In this step, the chosen syscall and control program will be prepared in a clean stage. Then the chosen provenance collecting tools will be started and record provenance of the execution of those programs with multiple trials. The provenance collecting tools will create one set of provenance results per trial per program. These results are collected from the provenance collecting tools and are further processed and analysed in our system to generate benchmarks. Currently, there are three types of output format supported: [Graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org/), [Neo4j Graph db (in full db or cypher dump of db)](https://neo4j.com/) and the [PROV-JSON](https://www.w3.org/Submission/2013/SUBM-prov-json-20130424/) format.

## Stage 2 Transform raw result to Clingo graph format
[Potassco Clingo](https://potassco.org/) is an Answer Set Programming tool that provides powerful modelling ability to solve combinatorial problems. We make use of it to solve the complicated graph comparison problems for matching vertices and edges in multiple trials of benchmark program execution for generalization of graphs and identification of additional elements (benchmarks of a syscall for certain provenance collecting tools). In this step, the system will run a different script to transform the raw result generated by the provenance collecting tools to clingo graph format for further processing. As this provenance information is supposed to describe the execution trace of the chosen syscall program, it is always possible to transform into a directed graph. Each trial result will be transformed into one clingo graph for the next stage.

## Stage 3 Generalize resulting graph for multiple trial
In this stage, multiple clingo graphs descirbing the multiple trials of the same program execution will be put together to be compared. The clingo graph will match the elements in the graph two by two and provide a matching list of nodes and edges with least edit distance. Then the properties in the graph will be compared one by one, and noise will be identified and removed. The result of this stage should be a generalized graph for the control program and another generalized graph for the chosen syscall program. They should contain the information which is truly related to the program execution with minimum noise.

## Stage 4 Generating benchmark of chosen syscall for chosen provenance collecting tool
This is the last stage of the benchmarking system execution. In this stage, the two generalized graphs will be compared to each other. As we assume that the chosen syscall is always a few steps or command more than the control program execution and they are both executed based on a same stage environment with the same language. So the additional elements in the generalized syscall graph shows the patterns that can be used as a benchmark to identify this syscall when we are using the chosen provenance collecting tools. All those addtional branches and properties will be identified and summarized in the result file in clingo format. Currently, this is the end of the full system. The clingo format graph can be transformed into Graphiz DOT format which allows further transformation to general displayable image.
