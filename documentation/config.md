# ProvMark configuration

Configuration of ProvMark is done by modifying config/config.ini file. It should not be needed in common cases.

In ProvMark system, the first two stages collect provenance information from provenancee collecting tools and transform the provenance result into a clingo graph. Different tools need different process handling and type conversion. These configuration parameters are stored in the config.ini file.

Each profile starts with the name and includes three settings as follows:

- stage1tool: define the script (and parameter) for stage 1 handling when this profile is chosen

- stage2handler: define which graph handler is used to handle the raw provenance information when this profile is chosen

- filtergraphs: define if graph filtering is needed. The default value for SPADE and OPUS is false and true for CamFlow. The graph filtering is a mechanism provided by ProvMark to filter out obviously incomplete or incorrect graphs generated by the provenance systems. It can increase the accuracy for the resulting benchmark, but it will decrease the efficiency.
- template: the prefix attached to the working file when this profile is chosen.
- threshold: threshold value set to allow some noise and error in the evaluation stage.

Each profile defines one supporting tool and its configuration. If new tools are supported in ProvMark, a new profile will be created here.
