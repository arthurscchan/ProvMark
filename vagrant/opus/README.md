As OPUS is not published anywhere in the internet, it is not able to generate a vargrant file that completely install opus within. 
The attached vargrant file is just for building the environment for opus and prov mark. You will need to obtain your own copy of 
OPUS and extracted within the vagrant VM in order to use OPUS with Prov Mark system.
